// MARK: - AppStateTestSupport
//
// Test-only helpers for spinning up an `AppStateStore` whose persistence is
// fully isolated from the production App Group container.
//
// The bug this guards against: tests used to construct `AppStateStore()` with
// no arguments, which fell through to the shared App Group `UserDefaults`
// (`group.com.podcastr.app`). Anything a test wrote — `Test Show`, `Episode
// e1`, etc. — survived the test run and showed up the next time the actual
// app launched on the simulator.
//
// `makeIsolatedStore()` builds a `Persistence` bound to a unique temp file
// URL, so:
//
//   - Each test instance starts from a clean slate (no cross-test bleed).
//   - Nothing the tests write touches the real App Group container.
//   - The temp file is removed via `FileManager.removeItem` in `tearDown`.
//
// The storage primitive intentionally matches production (`Data.write` to a
// JSON file inside an App-Group-style container). Tests written against the
// previous `UserDefaults`-backed `Persistence` would have round-tripped a
// few KB of state without ever stressing the actual failure mode that broke
// real users — see `testIsolatedStorePersistsLargeStateAcrossInstances` for
// the regression test that does.
