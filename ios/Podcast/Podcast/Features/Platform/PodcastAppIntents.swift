// MARK: - PodcastAppIntents
//
// iOS `AppIntents` performers — the M11 platform-integration surface that
// lets Siri / Shortcuts / Spotlight / Action Button drive playback. Each
// intent is a thin shell over `KernelModel.dispatch`: per D7, the iOS side
// only **translates** the user's intent into a kernel action and then steps
// out of the way. Policy ("which episode is `latest`?", "what does `resume`
// load when nothing was playing?") lives in the Rust kernel.
//
// Architecture:
//   - All intents are `@MainActor` because `KernelModel.dispatch` and
//     `KernelModel.podcastSnapshot` are `@MainActor`-isolated.
//   - The intents resolve the live `KernelModel` via the static `weak`
//     reference published by `KernelModel.init`. An `AppIntent` cannot
//     reach `@Environment` — it runs on the OS-driven extension queue
//     with no SwiftUI view tree attached.
//   - `openAppWhenRun = false` everywhere. Media-control intents that
//     force-foreground are bad UX (a Siri "Pause" should not yank the
//     app into view). The exception is `StartVoiceModeIntent` (defined
//     in the legacy `Podcastr` target) which needs the orb visible.
//   - Each intent maps to one Rust action id (`podcast.player.*`).
//     There is no `podcast.player.skip_forward` in the Rust contract;
//     skip is expressed as a `seek` to `position + 30`. There is no
//     `podcast.player.play_latest` either; iOS selects the episode
//     from `snapshot.library` and dispatches the existing `play`.
//
// File-length budget: four intents + one provider ≈ 200 lines. If a
// fifth intent lands and we cross 300 lines, split per-intent into
// individual files.
