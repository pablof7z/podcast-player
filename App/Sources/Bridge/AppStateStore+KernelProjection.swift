// MARK: - KernelModel → AppState projection
//
// Observes both `KernelModel.library` (library-hash-gated: updates on
// subscribe/unsubscribe/mark-played/starred/download changes) and
// `KernelModel.podcastSnapshot` (content-hash-gated: updates on queue/
// settings/nowPlaying changes) using `withObservationTracking` so a single
// property change in either triggers a full projection pass — no fixed polling.
//
// Why two observables: `KernelModel` keeps them separate to avoid re-rendering
// list views at 4 Hz during playback.  The content hash that gates
// `podcastSnapshot` intentionally excludes library fields, so starred/played/
// download mutations only advance `library`, not `podcastSnapshot`.  If we
// watched only `podcastSnapshot` we would miss all library-only mutations.
//
// ID stability: Rust emits UUIDv5 strings for both PodcastId and EpisodeId
// (derived from feedURL|guid). `UUID(uuidString:)` parses them reliably,
// preserving foreign-key relationships across the projection.
