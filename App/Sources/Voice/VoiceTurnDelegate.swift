// MARK: - VoiceTurnDelegate

/// Bridge between `AudioConversationManager` (Voice) and the agent session
/// (currently `AgentChatSession` in `Features/Agent/`).
///
/// `AgentChatSession` is intentionally NOT modified by Lane 8 — Lane 10
/// (or the orchestrator at merge time) supplies a small adapter that
/// conforms `AgentChatSession` to this protocol. That adapter owns the
/// observation of `streamingContent` / `phase` and translates them into
/// the streaming-text contract Voice needs.
///
/// ## Why a streaming AsyncThrowingStream?
///
/// Voice mode wants three signals per turn:
///   1. Incremental assistant text — to feed the TTS client and captions
///      as soon as the first sentence is available (sub-second latency).
///   2. A clean "this turn finished" signal — so we transition out of the
///      `speaking` state and arm the recogniser for the next user utterance.
///   3. A failure signal — so the manager can transition into `error(_)`.
///
/// `AsyncThrowingStream<TurnEvent, Error>` carries all three with backpressure
/// for free. The alternative — observing `@Observable` properties on
/// `AgentChatSession` — leaks main-actor coupling into the manager and makes
/// barge-in cancellation racy. Streams are cancellable via `Task.cancel()`.
///
/// All methods are `@MainActor`-isolated because every conforming type so
/// far is a main-actor `@Observable` session. If a future implementation is
/// off-main, redeclare per-method isolation rather than dropping the
/// `@MainActor` here.

    ///   - Yield `.finalText(_)` once the turn produces its final text-only
    ///     reply (or an empty string if the turn ended in tool calls only).
    ///   - Finish the stream cleanly on success or throw on failure.

    /// cancels the consuming `Task` to unwind any in-flight LLM call.
