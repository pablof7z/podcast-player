/// existing `CitationPeekView` content:
///
/// - Rises ~1/3 from the bottom (caller picks the detents).
/// - **Autoplays** the cited 12 seconds the moment the sheet appears.
/// - On dismiss, **restores** the prior playback context — episode,
///   playhead, and play/pause state — so a peek never hijacks what the user
///   was already listening to.
///
/// The 12-second window matches the brief; if the citation's own span is
/// longer, the sheet still autoplays from `startMS` and lets natural
/// dismissal stop the audio. If the citation is shorter, we play out the
/// citation and idle until the user dismisses.
