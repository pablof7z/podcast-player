// MARK: - SignedNostrEvent
//
// A plain Codable DATA struct mirroring the NIP-01 wire shape. This is NOT
// crypto — it carries no key material and performs no signing. It is the
// decoded shape of an event delivered by the kernel's feedback projection
// (`FeedbackEventDTO.asSignedEvent` in `PodcastUpdate.generated.swift`), and
// is consumed by the feedback thread builder (`FeedbackModels`,
// `FeedbackStore.buildThreads`).
//
// All signing and key ownership lives in the Rust kernel (NMP). The Swift app
// never constructs, signs, or verifies these events — it only reads the fields
// the kernel already populated to render feedback threads.

/// Fully-signed Nostr event, as decoded from the kernel feedback projection.
/// A passive data carrier — `id` / `pubkey` / `sig` are read-only fields the
/// kernel filled in, never computed here.
struct SignedNostrEvent: Sendable, Equatable, Codable {
    let id: String        // 32-byte hex event id (computed kernel-side).
    let pubkey: String    // 32-byte hex x-only pubkey of the author.
    let created_at: Int
    let kind: Int
    let tags: [[String]]
    let content: String
    let sig: String       // 64-byte hex signature (produced kernel-side).
}

// NIP-10 thread reconstruction (root/reply/`a`-coordinate tag parsing) used to
// live here as a `SignedNostrEvent` extension consumed by the feedback thread
// builder. As of #354 that reduction runs kernel-side
// (`ffi::feedback_threads`), which emits a resolved `feedbackThreads`
// projection — the shell no longer parses feedback event tags.
