// MARK: - EpisodeRowContextMenu

/// Shared "long-press menu" for any episode row in the app.
///
/// Surfaces:
///   - Open episode details (NavigationLink with a caller-supplied route value).
///   - Mark as played / Mark as unplayed (toggle based on `episode.played`).
///   - Download / Cancel download / Remove download / Retry download
///     (state-aware via `EpisodeDownloadService.shared`).
///   - Share (`ShareLink` with the enclosure URL).
///
/// The route is generic over `Hashable` so Library can pass `LibraryEpisodeRoute`
/// and Home can pass `HomeEpisodeRoute` without either feature owning the menu.
///
/// Usage with `.contextMenu`:
/// ```swift
/// .contextMenu {
///     EpisodeRowContextMenu(
///         episode: ep,
///         store: store,
///         openDetailsRoute: LibraryEpisodeRoute(...)
///     )
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Usage with `.accessibilityActions` (mirror the same items so VoiceOver
/// users get the same affordances — see `episodeRowAccessibilityActions`):
