/// Low-cardinality metadata stays in a JSON file. High-cardinality `Episode`
/// records live in a SQLite sidecar so a large imported library does not turn
/// every launch and mutation into a 70MB+ JSON decode/encode.
///
/// **Why a file, not `UserDefaults`.** A previous iteration wrote the blob to
/// `UserDefaults(suiteName: <App Group>)`. Once a user subscribed to a real
/// podcast, `state.episodes` ballooned the encoded blob past a few MB and
/// `cfprefsd` silently dropped the value on the next read — `data(forKey:)`
/// returned the previous (smaller) committed version, so anything written
/// after the size crossover was lost. The symptom was: complete onboarding,
/// kill the app, relaunch, and onboarding shows again because the
/// `hasCompletedOnboarding=true` save (which by then sat alongside the
/// episode list) never came back through the prefs daemon. `UserDefaults` is
/// fundamentally not designed for blobs of this size; the App Group
/// container's filesystem is.
///
/// **Atomic writes.** Saves go through `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` so a
/// crash mid-write leaves the previous good blob in place rather than a
/// half-written file that would fail to decode and silently reset the user
/// to a fresh `AppState`.
///
/// **Production vs. tests.** Construct via `Persistence.shared` for production
/// (writes to `<app-group>/Library/Application Support/podcastr-state.v1.json`).
/// Tests construct an isolated instance against a unique temp file URL so
/// fixtures never leak into the real app's storage — the bug where launching
/// the app after running the test target showed phantom "Test Show" /
/// "Episode e1" was caused by both contexts writing to the same App Group key.
