// MARK: - AppStateStore + PositionDebounce
//
// **Why this exists.** The audio engine ticks once per second while playback
// runs and forwards the playhead through `setEpisodePlaybackPosition`. Before
// this file landed, every one of those ticks mutated `state.episodes`, which
// fires `state.didSet`, which atomically rewrites the entire ~8 MB JSON blob
// at `<App Group>/Library/Application Support/podcastr-state.v1.json`. That's
// 480 MB of disk I/O per minute of playback — battery, NAND wear, and a main-
// actor stall every second.
//
// **The fix (Option A — debounce position writes only).** Position updates
// flow through a side cache (`positionCache`) instead of straight into
// `state.episodes`. The cache is folded back into reads (`episode(id:)`,
// `inProgressEpisodes`, `recentEpisodes`) so UI surfaces always see the
// latest playhead. Disk writes happen only when we need them:
//
//   - **Eager-first:** the very first position update after a flush is
//     written immediately. Rationale: a crash 0.5 sec after playback starts
//     mustn't lose all progress. It also keeps the existing single-call
//     `setEpisodePlaybackPosition` semantics — the position lands in
//     `state.episodes` straight away when the loop hasn't started yet.
//   - **Trailing debounce:** once the eager save fires, subsequent rapid
//     updates queue in the cache. A `Task` schedules a flush 5 sec after
//     the last update — covering the "user paused mid-episode" case where
//     no other natural flush event will fire.
//   - **Max-interval cap:** if updates keep streaming faster than the
//     debounce can settle (continuous playback), the eager-first gate
//     re-opens after `maxInterval` (30 sec). So the worst case is one
//     write per 30 sec during continuous playback — meeting the "≤ 30 sec
//     of position lost on crash" constraint without hammering the file.
//
// **Hard flush events.** Some transitions need the cache on disk *now*:
//
//   - `markEpisodePlayed(_:)` — the played-true mutation resets the
//     position to 0; the cache must drain *before* that or we'd silently
//     overwrite the user's actual end-position.
//   - `UIApplication.didEnterBackgroundNotification` — force-quit window.
//   - `clearAllData()` — the cache holds positions for episodes that are
//     about to be wiped; flush would attempt to mutate gone records.
//
// All other state mutations (subscribe, settings change, etc.) are rare and
// the user expects them durable, so they stay on the existing
// `state.didSet → save` path.
