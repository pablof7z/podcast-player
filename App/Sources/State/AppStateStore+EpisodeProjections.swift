// MARK: - AppStateStore + EpisodeProjections
//
// **Why this exists.** Several SwiftUI surfaces — the Library subscriptions
// grid, ShowDetail, Home Today's Continue Listening + New Episodes feeds —
// read derived facts about `state.episodes`. Each fact is O(N) to compute
// (filter / sort / contains). Each fact is read inside a `body` getter that
// SwiftUI re-runs every scroll tick, every cell. With 20 subscriptions and
// 10k episodes, scrolling Library used to fire 20 × 10k = 200k filter
// iterations *per scroll tick*. The `unplayedCount(forPodcast:)` frame
// alone showed up at 27 ticks in `sample` — the call graph was dominated by
// per-cell helpers iterating the entire episode array and copying full
// `Episode` structs.
//
// The fix: precompute every O(N) fact once, off `state.episodes`, into a
// dictionary or set keyed by subscription ID (or, for the Home feeds, into
// a flat sorted array). Reads become O(1) dict lookups, the per-cell
// helpers become trivial.
//
// **Cache shape.** Stored on `AppStateStore` itself (extensions can't add
// stored state); see `AppStateStore.swift` for the property declarations.
//
// **Invalidation.** Every method in `AppStateStore+Episodes.swift` that
// mutates `state.episodes` calls `invalidateEpisodeProjections()` after
// the mutation lands. As a safety net, `state.didSet` also recomputes
// when the array fingerprint changes — covering bulk assignments
// (`clearAllData`, persistence reload) and the one episode-removing path
// in `removeSubscription` over in `+Podcasts`.
//
// **Position-cache fold.** `inProgressEpisodes` and `recentEpisodes`
// surface live playhead values via the position-debounce cache (see
// `AppStateStore+PositionDebounce.swift`). The cache is folded into the
// returned values *at read time*, not stored in the precomputed array,
// so a 1 Hz playback tick doesn't dirty the projection.
//
// **Memory.** Per-show projections store sorted indexes into `state.episodes`,
// not full `Episode` copies. Reads materialize just the visible show's slice,
// keeping the large imported-library footprint lower than a duplicate cache.
