// MARK: - Podcast tool schema (OpenAI tool format)
//
// This file declares the OpenAI-compatible JSON-schema entries for every
// podcast-domain tool the agent can call. The orchestrator concatenates this
// array onto `AgentTools.schema` at merge time:
//
//     let allTools = AgentTools.schema + AgentTools.podcastSchema
//
// Adding a new podcast tool requires four steps, in order:
//   1. Add the canonical name to `AgentTools.PodcastNames`
//      in `AgentTools+Podcast.swift`.
//   2. Add a `tool(...)` entry below.
//   3. Add a `case` in `AgentTools.dispatchPodcast(...)`.
//   4. Add a unit test in `AgentToolsPodcastTests.swift`.

                Single play verb. Covers library episodes, one-off external URLs, jump-to-timestamp, \
                bounded-segment playback, and queue management — pick `queue_position` to control \
                whether playback starts now or the episode lands in Up Next. \
                Identify the episode with `episode_id` when it is already in the library \
                (from list_episodes / search_episodes / list_recent_unplayed / etc.). Otherwise pass \
                `audio_url` plus `title` to play an arbitrary URL (e.g. an enclosure from \
                search_podcast_directory or a user-pasted link); include `feed_url` when you have it \
                so the app captures the show's real artwork and metadata, otherwise the episode parents \
                to an "Unknown" podcast row. \
                Use this when the user says 'play that part where…' (start_seconds), \

                or 'add this to my queue' (queue_position=end). \
                For multi-segment playback (e.g. 'play the intro then the interview part'), call this \
                tool once per segment — first with queue_position=now, the rest with queue_position=end. \
                A subtle audio cue marks each transition when the queue advances.
