// MARK: - PodcastAgentToolDeps
//
// This file defines the dependency surface that the lane-10 podcast tools
// dispatch into. Every protocol here is intentionally **value-typed in / value-typed
// out** so the caller can supply mocks in tests and lane-1..9 implementations at
// merge time.
//
// Lane 10 owns the tool surface; other lanes own the protocol implementations.
// At wire-up time the orchestrator constructs a single `PodcastAgentToolDeps`
// (typically in `AppStateStore` or an `AgentChatSession` factory) and passes it
// to `AgentTools.dispatchPodcast(...)`.
//
// All protocols are declared `Sendable` because the dispatch is `async` and may
// hop actors. Implementations that touch `@MainActor` state should mark their
// methods `@MainActor`; the protocol surface tolerates either.
//
// Value-type result envelopes (`EpisodeHit`, `BriefingResult`, etc.) live in
// `PodcastAgentToolValues.swift`.
