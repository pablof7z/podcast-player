# LLM Provider Credential Resolver

## API Key Requirements

AgentLLMClient requires a non-empty API key via LLMProviderCredentialResolver before dispatching any request, even for keyless local Ollama instances. LLMProviderCredentialResolver.requiresAPIKey(for:ollamaChatURL:) centralizes the cloud-vs-local decision: an ollama.com host requires an API key, while any other host makes the key optional. Perplexity is supported as a Provider with BYOK and manual key storage through Keychain; no raw key is stored in app settings. Provider/settings rows check actual Keychain availability where touched, rather than trusting metadata only. The `perplexity_search` agent tool schema is not hidden when no Perplexity key is present. LLM dispatch consolidation (PR #386) collapses 6 copy-pasted resolve-model → validate-credentials → dispatch blocks into complete_for_role, and 3 duplicate extract_json implementations into canonical versions in src/llm/. The LLM client is dispatched via backend_for(store, model) which routes to Ollama, OpenRouter, or LocalModelBackend based on settings — no hardcoded localhost:11434.
