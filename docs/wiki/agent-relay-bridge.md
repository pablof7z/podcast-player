# Agent Relay Bridge

## Legacy Reply Path Removal

The dead legacy `reply(to:from:)` path on AgentRelayBridge, which had zero callers outside AgentRelayBridge.swift itself and did not attach peer context (causing peer tools to silently error), has been deleted. <!-- [^0f3f2-8] -->

## End Conversation Tool Behavior

NostrAgentResponder.swift was deleted in PR #248, meaning agent-to-agent auto-reply is dead functionality that needs kernel restoration rather than refactoring. The kernel kind:1 auto-responder restores it: trusted inbound kind:1 triggers complete_for_role reply via handle_publish_agent_note with dedup (bounded RespondedIds ring capped at 4096 entries via a VecDeque+HashSet ring that evicts the oldest when over cap, persisting across identity switches — global/account-agnostic by design since dedup can only suppress, never over-reply), max 10 outgoing turns per root, and wtd-end conversation-termination gating.

## Relay Reactivity

Relay reactivity is Rust-side via a DispatchHostOp rev-bump; no optimistic local mirror is needed in Swift. <!-- [^14943-3] -->

Relay reactivity is Rust-side via a DispatchHostOp rev-bump; no optimistic local mirror is needed in Swift. Feedback publishing routes through the kernel's NMP relay pool; FeedbackRelayClient's WebSocket actor is deleted. <!-- [^c43d5-1] -->

No WebSocket awareness (URLSessionWebSocketTask, direct relay connections) belongs in Swift; all Nostr relay communication is NMP's responsibility. (Previously: The agent connects via WebSocket to wss://relay.tenex.chat using the agent key 5f6280b5d948… and subscribes to kind:1 Nostr events mentioning that key. <!--  -->, superseded — see nostr-rust-ffi.)

## Action Results Registry

ActionResultsRegistry in Swift mirrors SignedEventsRegistry with drain-once semantics and NSLock-protected buffering so a result frame arriving between dispatchSilent and awaitResult registration is not lost. <!-- [^c1691-175] -->

## Stale Comment Rewrite

The register.rs comment block at lines 233–262 was stale and contradicted the code (relay persistence via C-ABI path now exists at ffi/data_dir.rs:112 and host_op_handler/settings_actions.rs:391), and was rewritten to reflect the actual state. <!-- [^c1691-202] -->

## Orphaned Approval Scaffolding

iOS NostrPendingApprovals/NostrApprovalPresenter are orphaned dead scaffolding — nothing populates the pending queue, and the allow/block sets gate nothing in the kernel. They are deleted in the v1 conversations vertical. <!-- [^c1691-236] -->
