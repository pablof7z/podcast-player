# Nostr Relay Migration

## Dead Code Removal

NostrRelayCapability.swift, NostrRelayService, NostrCommentService, NIP65RelayFetcher, NostrProfileFetcher, NostrThreadFetcher, NostrEventPublisher, and the Nip46/ directory (except NostrSigner.swift) are dead code and must be deleted.

<!-- citations: [^c43d5-26] [^c43d5-36] -->
## Tag and Relay Construction

Swift must not parse or construct Nostr event tags; it passes semantic values (recipient, root, inbound ID, channel anchors) and Rust constructs all NIP-10 tags. Swift does not encode default relays or event coordinate tagging logic — relay URLs come from the kernel snapshot and tag construction lives in Rust.

## Agent Responder Migration Sequence

Agent responder migration to Rust follows a 4-step sequence: (1) kill NostrEventPublisher by dispatching publish_agent_note via kernel, (2) kill NostrProfileFetcher via kind:0 EnsureInterest observer, (3) kill NostrThreadFetcher via kind:1 #e EnsureInterest one-shot, (4) move the LLM responder loop to Rust.
