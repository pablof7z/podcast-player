# NMP Relay Configuration

## Relay Configuration

Relay configuration must be provided to the NMP app builder at startup, not at publish or subscription time. NMP v0.2.1 allows apps to configure app-level relays (indexer and content roles) via set_initial_relays_for_start. The UI must allow users to configure app relays, their own NIP-65 relays, and agent NIP-65 relays. The podcast app must not specify relay URLs at publish time; it must configure relays at startup and let NMP drive all routing via PublishTarget::Auto. Nostr publishing for events signed with the user's key (kind:10064, kind:1111, kind:1) must use NMP's PublishRaw dispatch so NMP handles signing and relay routing without the app touching secrets. Per-podcast events (kind:10154/54) are pre-signed in Rust with per-podcast keys and dispatched via nmp.publish with PublishTarget::Auto until NMP exposes a sign-as-non-active-account API. Nostr subscriptions for comments (kind:1111) and agent notes (kind:1) must use NMP's push_interest and KernelEventObserver pattern instead of iOS WebSocket capability connections. The Swift/iOS layer must not contain any WebSocket awareness for Nostr relay communication; all relay connectivity is NMP's responsibility. Event publishing must use PublishTarget::Auto via nmp_app_dispatch_action("nmp.publish", ...) so NMP routes through configured relays with zero relay URLs specified by the podcast app. dispatch_nostr_relay must read write-capable relays from NmpApp::configured_relays_handle() instead of hardcoding wss://relay.primal.net.
