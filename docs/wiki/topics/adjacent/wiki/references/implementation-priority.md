# Implementation Priority

Adjacent ideas should not distract from core playback, transcripts, wiki compilation, retrieval, and voice. Sequence them where they reinforce the core.

## Near-Term

- Parse and store Podcasting 2.0 metadata already relevant to the app: chapters, transcript, person, soundbite, podroll, funding, location, and alternateEnclosure.
- Add snip/highlight model with timestamp, transcript text, speaker, note, and tags.
- Export generated wiki pages and highlights as Markdown.
- Add App Intent entry points for start voice mode, resume, save snip, and start briefing.

## Mid-Term

- Support NotebookLM-style briefing formats: brief, deep dive, critique, debate.
- Add daily review of podcast highlights.
- Render creator recommendations from podrolls.
- Show OP3 public stats where available.
- Add Live Activity citation/chapter surface.

## Later

- socialInteract comment reading/posting.
- Value4Value payments or boost-like timestamp support.
- liveItem listening rooms.
- generated video overviews.
- full Obsidian vault sync and Readwise-style integrations.

## Product Risk

The social, payments, and live features are rich but can pull the app away from the core "converse with my podcast library" promise. Metadata parsing, snips, exports, and ambient controls are safer because they directly strengthen that promise.
