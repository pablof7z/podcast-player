# BYOK Connect Service

## Precondition Checks

BYOKConnectService has a preconditionFailure when no UIWindowScene is available, serving as a developer-contract guard. <!-- [^0f3f2-25] -->

## Provider Support

BYOK supports Ollama Cloud as a first-class provider with scope 'key:ollama'. <!-- [^rollo-8] -->

## Connect Flow & Key Storage

The podcast player can request an Ollama Cloud API key through BYOK via a PKCE connect flow, with BYOK/manual/none metadata tracked and raw keys stored only in Keychain. <!-- [^rollo-9] -->

## Raw Key Reveal Endpoint

BYOK's raw key reveal endpoint uses POST only (not GET) to avoid browser/query log exposure, is authenticated, no-store, and returns the raw key only for keys owned by the signed-in user. <!-- [^rollo-10] -->

## Key Editor UI

BYOK's key editor UI has a raw key reveal panel with Show/Hide/Copy, and does not persist the raw key in app state. <!-- [^rollo-11] -->
