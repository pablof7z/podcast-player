# Diagnostic Logging

## Architecture & Performance

Diagnostic logging uses an in-memory ring buffer (500 entries) with a toggle defaulting to off, ensuring zero overhead when disabled. The diagnostic log append function uses @autoclosure so that kernel-tick string interpolation is allocation-free when logging is disabled.

## Captured Events

Diagnostic logging captures kernel snapshot ticks, download events, audio commands, every kernel.dispatch call, store open failures, and app foreground/background transitions.

## App Lifecycle Integration

The app uses the modern scene-based lifecycle pattern, using @Environment(\.scenePhase) for actual foreground/background transitions and @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor only for UIKit-owned responsibilities like background URL session reconnection and Siri shortcuts. App lifecycle logging is wired through the scenePhase switch in AppMain.swift, not AppDelegate lifecycle methods, because the app is scene-based and AppDelegate lifecycle methods never fire when scenes are active. <!-- [^e1cfd-5] -->

## User Interface

The diagnostic logs UI is located in Settings > Debug, featuring a toggle to enable logging and a log viewer with color-coded entries, copy-all, and clear actions. <!-- [^e1cfd-6] -->
