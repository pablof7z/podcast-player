# Disk Full Recovery (ENOSPC)

> Procedure for recovering from a full macOS data volume (ENOSPC) that blocks builds and codex reviews. Primary space hogs: ~/.cargo/target-shared (83 GB) and stale DerivedData.

## Overview

The macOS data volume hitting 100% full (0 bytes free) blocks all operations: builds, codex reviews, and log writes fail with ENOSPC (exit 101). This occurred during the M1 codex review cycle. The primary space hogs are the iOS build cache (83 GB in ~/.cargo/target-shared) and stale Xcode DerivedData directories (~9 Podcastr-* dirs at ~7 GB total). [^14943-62]

## Recovery Steps

The recovery procedure: (1) Remove the iOS build cache: rm -rf ~/.cargo/target-shared. This reclaimed 83 GB. (2) Remove stale DerivedData dirs: rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Podcastr-* (keeping the active worktree's hash). (3) After clearing, re-verify with df -h. Total reclaimed: ~90 GB. (4) Side effect: the iOS simulator static library must be rebuilt from scratch after clearing the cache, as it was the canonical source. This takes several minutes for the full NMP dependency graph. [^14943-63]

## Detection

ENOSPC is detected when codex exec review fails with exit code 101 or builds fail with disk-full errors. The df -h command confirms the volume at 100%. The codex review gate itself can flag this as an environmental issue. [^14943-64]
