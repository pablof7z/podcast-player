# NIP-74 Show Events

## NIP-F4 Show Events

NIP-F4 show events do not emit a d tag. They use a "description" tag instead of "summary". The publisher wire format for shows must use kind 10154 with description (not summary) and no d tag.

The NIP74Show type has no d_tag field, and its coordinate() method returns "10154:<pubkey>" with no d-tag component. Its summary field is renamed to description.

The podcast_to_show_tags function parameter changed from agent_pubkey to podcast_pubkey, making the signer the per-podcast key.

NIP-09 deletion for owned podcasts switched from e-tag (specific event id) to k-tag (kind:10154) targeting because the kernel signs and does not return the event id at dispatch time; a per-podcast key authors exactly one kind:10154 show, so kind-targeted deletion removes precisely that event with no over-deletion.

The show parser no longer requires a d tag and does not return MissingTag("d"). It reads the "description" tag (with content fallback) instead of "summary".

ShowReference is still valid for parsing legacy a tags and remains unchanged.

The show_d_tag_round_trips_lowercase test is replaced by show_coordinate_is_stable_per_pubkey.

NIP-F4 discovery uses the shared NDK instance as the sole relay-management mechanism (NostrPodcastDiscoveryService is the only component that directly calls addRelay() and connect() on it), with no secondary NDK instantiations or separate one-shot websocket connections. (Previously: NIP-F4 discovery must use the app-owned NDK relay pool and its existing connections, not a separate one-shot websocket connection, superseded — see nostr-rust-ffi.)

A publishAuthorClaim function must be added as kind 10064.

Tool/schema/UI/docs copy must be updated from NIP-74/naddr to NIP-F4/event id or podcast identity.

AgentToolsPodcastTests.testPublishEpisodeSuccessReturnsNaddr and MockOwnedPodcasts must be updated to expect event id instead of naddr.
