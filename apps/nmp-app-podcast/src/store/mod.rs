//! Podcast library store.
//!
//! Holds the set of subscribed podcasts and their episodes. Keyed by `PodcastId`
//! so lookups are O(1); the store is wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<PodcastStore>>` and
//! shared between the `PodcastHandle` (snapshot reader) and the
//! `PodcastHostOpHandler` (writer). All writes happen on the actor thread;
//! reads happen on the iOS main thread via `nmp_app_podcast_snapshot`.
//!
//! ## Persistence
//!
//! When [`PodcastStore::set_data_dir`] has been called the store mirrors every
//! mutation (`subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `update_refresh_metadata`) to a
//! single `podcasts.json` file inside that directory. Reads stay purely
//! in-memory; the disk file is a write-through cache so the library survives
//! app restarts.
//!
//! D6: persistence failures degrade silently — the in-memory store remains
//! authoritative and the next mutation will try to write again.
