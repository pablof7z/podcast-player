//! Pure JSON ↔ JSON bridge between the iOS audio capability and the
//! Rust [`crate::player::PlayerActor`].
//!
//! This is the seam M3.B will plug into the kernel-side `ActionModule`
//! and `CapabilityModule` registrations. Today it isolates the JSON
//! envelope handling from the actor itself so:
//!
//! 1. The actor stays a pure state machine (`PlayerActor::handle_audio_report`
//!    takes a typed `AudioReport`, not a string), keeping the unit tests
//!    cheap and the surface narrow.
//! 2. The kernel-side `ActionModule` (M3.B) and the iOS-side
//!    `PodcastCapabilities.handleJSON` router will all funnel through
//!    these helpers so the JSON shapes don't drift across the four
//!    layers (Swift encoder → C-ABI → Rust decoder → projection).
//!
//! D7 holds at every step: the helpers parse, project, and re-encode;
//! they never inspect content to make a playback decision. All decisions
//! live in [`crate::player::PlayerActor`].
