//! Podcast-local download capability contract — `nmp.download.capability`.
//!
//! This is the schema the iOS executor (`Capabilities/DownloadCapability.swift`,
//! landing in M4.C) implements and the Rust [`crate::download::DownloadQueue`]
//! drives. Rust serializes a [`DownloadCommand`]; iOS executes it against a
//! background `URLSession` and sends a [`DownloadReport`] back.
//!
//! ## Doctrine
//!
//! * **D7 — capabilities report, never decide.** iOS downloads exactly what
//!   Rust tells it to download and reports exactly what happens. It never
//!   decides which queued item starts next on `Completed`/`Failed`/`Cancelled`,
//!   never decides whether to retry on `Failed`, never decides whether to
//!   honour a per-subscription auto-download policy. Queue order, concurrency
//!   cap, retry behaviour, and policy evaluation all live in
//!   [`crate::download::DownloadQueue`] and `podcast-feeds::refresh::policy`
//!   (M4.B).
//! * **D4 — single writer.** The Rust-side `DownloadQueue` is the sole writer
//!   of download state. iOS holds only `URLSessionDownloadTask`s and the maps
//!   needed to associate them with `episode_id`s; the projection that the UI
//!   reads comes from Rust.
//! * **D6 — error envelopes.** `Failed` carries an `error: String` payload;
//!   the capability never throws across the FFI.
//!
//! ## Namespace
//!
//! The namespace string is `nmp.download.capability` to match
//! `HttpCapability::namespace` / `KeychainCapability` convention and the
//! active NMP feature-parity plan.
//!
//! ## Schema stability
//!
//! This is the M4.A skeleton — a podcast-local two-enum Command/Report shape.
//! The canonical `nmp-core::capability::download` uses a three-enum
//! `Request`/`Response`/`Event` split with task ids,
//! `dest_path`, `etag`, and `if_modified_since` for conditional fetches.
//! When that lands in `nostrmultiplatform`, M4.B/C will reconcile this
//! contract against the canonical one in a follow-up migration. The split
//! here is deliberately narrower so the iOS executor in M4.C has a stable
//! target to implement *now* without blocking on the cross-repo dependency.
//! In particular, dest_path is left to the capability (legacy iOS uses
//! `Application Support/Downloads/<episode_id>.mp3`); etag/if-modified-since
//! land alongside resume-token support in M4.A's follow-up.
