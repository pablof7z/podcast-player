//! Compound NIP-F4 publishing ActionModule (`podcast.publish` namespace).
//!
//! Routes every NIP-F4 owned-podcast publishing op: synthetic-row
//! creation (`create_synthetic_podcast`), per-podcast keypair
//! lifecycle (`create_owned_podcast` / `remove_owned_podcast`), show
//! event build (`publish_show`, kind:10154), episode event build
//! (`publish_episode`, kind:54), the agent-side ownership claim
//! (`publish_author_claim`, kind:10064), and the full owned-podcast
//! update/delete lifecycle (`update_owned_podcast`, `delete_owned_podcast`).
//!
//! All "publish" ops currently return
//! `{"ok": true, "status": "relay_pending", "event_tags": [...]}` and
//! stamp the constructed event JSON onto the handle's `publish_state`
//! map so the iOS shell can render "last built event" diagnostics. Real
//! relay-side publishing is wired through once the NMP Nostr relay
//! plumbing for per-app keypairs lands.
//!
//! ## D0 / D7
//!
//! The action module itself only routes — it serializes the typed
//! [`PublishAction`] back to JSON and emits a `DispatchHostOp`
//! `ActorCommand`. The host-op handler (running on the actor thread,
//! see [`crate::host_op_handler`]) owns the actual build + state mutation.
//! That layering matches `PodcastActionModule` / `PlayerActionModule`.
