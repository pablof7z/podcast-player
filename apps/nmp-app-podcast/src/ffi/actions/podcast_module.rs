//! Compound podcast ActionModule — routes all `"podcast.*"` dispatches.
//!
//! Swift encodes every podcast action as `{"op":"<variant>", ...fields}`.
//! The `#[serde(tag = "op", rename_all = "snake_case")]` discriminator maps
//! the string `op` value to the enum variant. The module's `execute` body
//! forwards the whole action as `ActorCommand::DispatchHostOp` so the
//! `PodcastHostOpHandler` (running on the actor thread) can call platform
//! capabilities without the kernel naming podcast-domain nouns (D0).
