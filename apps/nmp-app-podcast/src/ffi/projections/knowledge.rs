/// hybrid ranker (KNN + BM25 + RRF + reranker). The iOS shell renders

/// implementation (current stub: case-insensitive substring match over
/// `Episode.title` + `Episode.description`; follow-up: real embedding
/// search) without breaking the host decoder.

/// Fields:
///
/// * `episode_id` / `episode_title` / `podcast_title` — what the row
///   labels itself with. `episode_id` is the hyphenated UUID so the
///   iOS shell can dispatch `podcast.player.play` against it.
/// * `snippet` — the relevant text excerpt (up to ~200 chars). The
///   projection layer truncates so the UI never has to.
/// * `start_secs` — position in the episode the snippet appears at,
///   when the underlying chunk has a timestamp (transcripts will;
///   description-only matches stay `None`). The iOS shell renders a
///   "seek to" button only when this is set.
/// * `relevance_score` — `0.0..=1.0`. Used by the UI to render a
///   relevance bar and (incidentally) to validate the ranker's order
///   in a regression test. The stub uses a simple "how early in the
///   text did the query land" heuristic.
