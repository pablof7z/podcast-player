//! Podcast-specific action-registration helpers invoked from
//! [`super::register::nmp_app_podcast_register`].
//!
//! `nmp_app_podcast_register` calls `nmp_app_template::register_defaults` for
//! the canonical NMP action modules (NIP-02 / NIP-17 / NIP-57 / NIP-65) and
//! the production routing substrate. This file is the hook point for
//! **Podcast-specific** registrations that the template intentionally does not
//! ship — NIP-74 podcast feed actions, episode playback intents, chapter
//! navigation, etc.
//!
//! This is a placeholder for M0. Podcast-domain action modules will be added
//! here in subsequent milestones as the corresponding NIP crates are
//! implemented.
