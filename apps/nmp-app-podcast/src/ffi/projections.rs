//! Snapshot projection types — narrow, Codable-friendly mirrors of the
//! Rust-side state machines surfaced via [`super::snapshot::PodcastUpdate`].
//!
//! Lives in its own module to keep [`super::snapshot`] focused on the
//! C-ABI entry points and the typed root struct. Each projection here
//! is the *external* (FFI-wire) shape; the *internal* state machines
//! it derives from live in their domain crates (`podcast-briefings`,
//! `podcast-agent-core`, …) or in this crate's domain modules
//! (`crate::player`, `crate::download`).
//!
//! ## D7 / D6
//!
//! These structs are pure data: Swift `Codable` decodes them and renders.
//! No conditional logic, no policy decisions — the projection layer
//! that *builds* them owns those, and is colocated with the kernel-side
//! action modules in subsequent milestones (M3.B / M4.B / M7.B / M8.B
//! / M9.B).
