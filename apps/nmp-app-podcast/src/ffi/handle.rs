// SAFETY: the auto-derived `!Send`/`!Sync` comes solely from the
// `app: *mut NmpApp` field. The handle is sound to mark `Send + Sync` because:
//
//   1. Swift owns this handle and only ever touches it from one isolation
//      context. The FFI entry points are reached exclusively from `@MainActor`
//      types, so the handle itself is never raced. (This is a Swift-side caller
//      convention, not a type-system guarantee — documented, not enforced here.)
//   2. The `app` raw pointer is only ever *read* — never mutated from this
//      struct after construction.
//   3. `nmp_app_free` drops `NmpApp`, whose `Drop` sends `Shutdown` and then
//      `join()`s the actor thread before the allocation is freed, fencing any
//      in-flight callbacks.
//
// CALLER CONTRACT: `nmp_app_free` must not be invoked while any kernel
// callback that reaches this handle is still in flight. The in-process
// Rust-trait registration path gets that fence for free (the actor join).
