//! Wire relay selection is driven by the planner-resolved per-author write/read
//! relays (NIP-65), NOT by a hardcoded constant. Every [`OutboundMessage`]
//! carries an explicit `relay_url` — the resolved target the transport dials.
//! [`RelayRole`] survives ONLY as a transport-lane + diagnostics discriminator
//! (relay-health rows, NIP-42 driver buckets, `wire_subs` grouping); it is no
//! longer a routing source.
//!
//! [`BOOTSTRAP_DISCOVERY_RELAYS`] is the explicit, documented cold-start seed
//! used for the *very first* kind:10002 (NIP-65 relay-list) discovery fetch
//! when nothing is cached. It is NEVER the routing default — once an author's
//! kind:10002 is cached, the resolver routes to their declared relays and the
//! bootstrap seed is no longer consulted for that author (D3: outbox routing
//! automatic — `docs/product-spec/overview-and-dx.md` §1.5).
