//! Kernel ↔ `PublishEngine` wiring (T117).
//!
//! The publish engine (`crate::publish::PublishEngine`) is the per-(event,
//! relay) state machine that drives the publish retry FSM described in
//! `docs/research/relay-lifecycle-and-pools.md` §G5. Before T117 the engine
//! shipped but was dead code in production — `kernel::publish_cmd::publish_signed`
//! one-shotted a single `EVENT` frame and stamped `accepted_locally`. T117
//! routes every kernel publish through the engine instead.
//!
//! Doctrine map (canonical per `docs/product-spec/doctrine.md`):
//! - **D3** (outbox automatic): the engine is built against an
//!   `Arc<dyn OutboxResolver>` slot (default: `NoopOutboxResolver`);
//!   production composition (`nmp-defaults::register_defaults`) installs
//!   the router-side `nmp_router::Nip65OutboxResolver` via
//!   [`Kernel::set_publish_resolver`]. Every `Publish` uses
//!   `PublishTarget::Auto` so the installed resolver decides relays — no
//!   hardcoded URLs. With the default `NoopOutboxResolver` the engine
//!   surfaces `NoTargets` (fail-closed), exactly the same as the
//!   `Nip65OutboxResolver` does for an author with no kind:10002.
//! - **D4** (single writer per fact): only the kernel mutates engine state,
//!   only the engine mutates per-relay state. The actor holds the kernel
//!   one-thread, so the single-writer property is preserved.
//! - **D6** (no `Result` across FFI): every engine error is mapped into a
//!   `RecentFailure` snapshot row via `engine.record_engine_error` before the
//!   error propagates back across the kernel's plain-data return surface.
//! - **D7** (engine retries, native never decides): retry policy lives in
//!   the engine. The kernel only translates `OK` frames into `RelayAck`s and
//!   feeds them in via `on_ack`.
//! - **D8** (no per-event alloc on the resolve path): the `QueueDispatcher`
//!   appends to a single buffer; the kernel drains in bulk per publish call.
